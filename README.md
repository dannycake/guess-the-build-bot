# Guess The Build Bot

## Getting Started
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Latest/LTS)
2. Clone the Github repository or download the zip file
3. Open a terminal in the folder
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `node index.js [email]` to start the bot<br/>
   (where `[email]` is your microsoft account's email)

## How It Works
Based off the hints provided by Hypixel (e.g. Hy_____), the bot will search for all words from `lib/wordlist.js` that match the pattern, it'll then guess all those words.
This is older code, I was able to win approx. 50% of games played but it can definitely be improved.
